    <h2>Recycle at Christmas</h2>
      <p>It's that time of year again. Spiced Lattes are abound the coffee shops and twinkling lights adorn George Square. Christmas is a wonderful time that always seems to be over so quick! Soon enough, it is time to dismantle the christmas tree masterpieces from our living rooms, and figure out what to do with its browning, bare boughs.</p>
      <p>You can add a touch of eco-consciousness to this festive periodby disposing of your Christmas tree the green way.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Below is our advice on how you can recycle your Christmas tree in and around Glasgow.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Glasgow City Council advises real Christmas trees can be placed in your brown bins for kerbside collection. <em>To ensure collection, please cut the tree into pieces and ensure that the lid will close</em></p>
      <p>Alternatively, trees can be taken to any of the following household council recycling centres:<sup>[1]</sup></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dawsholm Recycling Centre - 75 Dalsholm Road, Glasgow, G20 0TB</li>
          <li>Easter Queenslie Recycling Centre - 90 Easter Queenslie Road, Glasgow, G33 4UL</li>

          <li>Shieldhall Recycling Centre - Renfrew Road, Glasgow, G51 4SL</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Real Christmas trees can also be taken to the following locations from 3 January until 19 January:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pollok Country Park, Burrell Car Park - <em>Chippings will be available for the public to take free of charge from Pollok Park</em></li>
          <li>Alexandra Park, off Alexandra Parade, car park next to the golf course</li>
